# Coding Principles Violated:
# DRY:
#   The code repeats itself a lot. Each operation has one function for the math
#   and another one just for input and printing, instead of reusing code.
#   Input handling is written out four separate times instead of being done once.
#
# Single Responsibility:
#   The functions are doing too many things at once. For example, add_numbers
#   both asks for input and does the math. The main function also takes care of
#   the menu, input, and running everything all in one place.
#
# Clean Code:
#   Thereâ€™s no error handling at all, so dividing by zero will crash the program.
#   Variable names are not descriptive, comments are basically missing, and the
#   overall structure is messy and harder to follow.
